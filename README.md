# Niyantri House - Restaurant Website

This project contains a 5-page restaurant site built with Tailwind CSS for styling and a dynamic, client-side cart experience using localStorage. It includes a responsive navigation, a Swiper-based hero gallery, a menu with add-to-cart actions, a cart page with a PayPal sandbox integration, and placeholder content tailored for Hyderabad, India.

Pages:
- index.html — Home with hero (Swiper), testimonials, and overview.
- menu.html — Menu with Add to Cart buttons.
- cart.html — Cart with items, total, and PayPal checkout button (sandbox).
- about.html — About Niyantri House.
- contact.html — Contact form and Hyderabad address placeholder.

Notes and features:
- All pages share the same header and footer layout.
- Cart state is stored in localStorage as JSON.
- Cart count updates on all pages; cart rendering occurs on cart.html.
- PayPal Sandbox integration uses client-id=sb.
- Images use placeholder syntax: src='https://pixabay.com/get/g4620927fdbf599efcead5df7a5834b44e20d1212ed07765a4d752b51f1f6d5ce39264ec6363c204f177a443f12503befd1b393b027d14efe22b15d6a9f7adbcb_640.jpg'.
- Footer includes the current year (2025).
- Responsive hamburger menu for mobile.
- Tailwind-based, with optional Swiper.js for image carousels.
- All icons are inline SVGs.

If you want any content customized (different menu items, locations, or color theme), tell me and I can adjust quickly.
